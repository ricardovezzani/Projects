# FirstProject
Hi, I'm Ricardo Vezzani, and this is my first project. I'm learning the C language and I'm a beginner, so don't expect too much. I'm a Computer Science student, and I did this small "project" to practice my skills. It went well â€” it wasn't an easy task, but I learned a lot from it.

This project is a Student Registration system where you can register students, search for them, delete them, and see all registered students. Any advice is welcome! Thanks.
